# Text-Mani

Text-Mani is a text manipulation app which allows the user to perform simple operations like comverting the text to uppercase or lowercase, copy the manipulated text to clipboard and clear the text box if required, to enter new text. 

The app has been created using React as the main framework, supported by Boostrap, and utilises the key web programming languages of HTML,CSS and JS. This is my first attempt at creating a React app.
